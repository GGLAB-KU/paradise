If you measure the circumference C and diameter d of a circle very precisely, then calculate C÷d{\displaystyle C\div d}, you always get π{\displaystyle \pi }.","You can find a square and circle with the same perimeter if given the area of either shape. The formula for the area of a circle is π(r2){\displaystyle \pi (r^{2})}. The formula for the area of a square is s2{\displaystyle s^{2}}. Solve for r{\displaystyle r} or s{\displaystyle s} first, then follow the steps above.","Equations for a circle or ellipse have an x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} term and a y2{\displaystyle y^{2}} term.

One way to think about this is to understand that when you integrate the radius integral first, you are ignoring whatever happens on the z-axis. After you sum from 0{\displaystyle 0} to a,{\displaystyle a,} there is a region in which you cannot integrate over, because there is only empty space there. We account for that fact when we set the side of the cone as the lower boundary.Similar to the above example, you are first integrating height, but that integral has no information on what happens radially. Since the radius starts with 0 and increases with height, it is easy to set the boundaries.If you are still unconvinced, solve the integral. You will get the same answer either way.",1
