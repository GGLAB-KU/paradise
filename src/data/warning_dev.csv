They have the same hourglass shaped mark on their underside, but it may be orange or other shades of color, and not usually red. Their body coloring is basically brown, but can be lighter to dark shades.  They can also have many colors/patterns on the top side that resemble a tattoo. While Brown Widow bites are also toxic, they deliver less venom, and so bites are only locally affected in the bite area and thus much safer than the Black Widow's. Their egg sacks are similar to the Black Widow, but have spikes protruding all around the egg sack which still resembles the basic shape of a very small cotton ball like the Black Widow. These Brown Widows are apparently much more abundant and are known for making webs in many more locations and heights than the Black Widow. Reports include webs at an adult's eye level. They are found under trash can handles, under lawn chairs, and even out in the open on chain link fencing. These require as much caution as the Black Widow. They don't attack when their egg sack is threatened, but instead will play dead. They make many more egg sacks than the Black Widow. If you find the spiky cotton ball egg sacks, you have Brown Widows. You can hunt them using the same procedures listed above.","To collect only good, sound acorns: sit under the tree like the Native Americans, picking up acorns, making sure to put holey ones into a trash container, or you will be picking them up again.

When you are done gathering, pitch the acorns into a bucket of water and skim off anything that floats. Put the skimmings into your compost; or better yet, dry and burn them since many of the floaters contain worms that are working on burrowing their way out; this is why they float.  Fewer worms mean fewer adults to lay eggs and more edible acorns!  The acorns that do not float are good.  If they are green, keep them in a dry, shaded place until they turn brown.","Collecting baboon spiders as pets is highly discouraged.

They are too risky, not only for yourself but for the safety of other drivers.Don't roll through stop signs or cut corners at high speeds to avoid braking.Don't turn off a car's engine to coast down hills. Turning off your engine will cause you to lose your power steering and brakes - your car will be very hard to steer and the brakes will become much less effective. Hybrid cars avoid this by having battery-powered steering and brake assist.There are some older (especially European) cars without power steering and/or power brakes. Don't lock your steering wheel during drive! Find a way to stop engine without locking it - kill switch for ignition would do the trick. You can start the engine again using car's momentum (at least when your car has manual transmission).Driving under the speed limit in heavy traffic where other vehicles can't pass you safely is extremely dangerous.","With manual transmission cars, be careful of causing sudden movements from using the clutch. If the car is in gear when the engine is turned on, it will lurch forward (or backward if it is in reverse) when the engine 'turns over'.

Practice with these cars and understand how manual transmissions work before driving places where you could get into an accident or harm someone.","Make sure you practice uphill starts when learning to drive a manual car. Because starting a manual from a stop requires letting off the brakes and engaging the clutch (essentially placing the car in neutral), the car will roll backward until first gear is engaged.

If the car has ABS, then the fastest way to stop is to literally press on the brake pedal as hard as you can.

Seemingly, this could lead to quite a variety of ways to pronounce any given word. Then again, look at the English language, and you will find similar properties to some words.
