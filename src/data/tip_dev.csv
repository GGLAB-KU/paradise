One way to think about this is to understand that when you integrate the radius integral first, you are ignoring whatever happens on the z-axis. After you sum from 0{\displaystyle 0} to a,{\displaystyle a,} there is a region in which you cannot integrate over, because there is only empty space there. We account for that fact when we set the side of the cone as the lower boundary.Similar to the above example, you are first integrating height, but that integral has no information on what happens radially. Since the radius starts with 0 and increases with height, it is easy to set the boundaries.If you are still unconvinced, solve the integral.

For example, ""The Big Mystery"" sounds like a kindergarten reader, while something like ""Mysteries of midnight"" sounds very dramatic. It tells about the story, something happens at midnight but it doesn't tell what is about.","To make your narrative paragraph engaging, bounce story ideas off a friend before you begin writing. It's best to focus on a moment that was special and transformative for you or your narrator rather than simply relating day-to-day events.","Look for more than just grammar.

However, blending the lavender oil with a carrier oil will extend the life of the oil because you don't have to use as much, and it will not affect the smell.","Instead of using essential oil, you could coat your air freshener with perfume or another scent you enjoy.

It's important to give yourself time to feel your emotions, think about them, learn from them, and even grieve the loss of your relationship. It's also not fair to the new person if you're still hung up on someone else.","Although you are not the only one involved and not the only one responsible, if you plan on ending the affair and staying with your partner, the person you have had the affair with deserves a full explanation and, in most cases, an apology for the emotional manipulation he or she may have been subjected to from you. Breaking the bond will be painful for him or her, but it must be a full break––it will be almost impossible to go back to any kind of functional ""friendship"" after such a dysfunctional bond.","Forgiveness is an important part of moving on after an affair, whether the affair was yours or your significant other's. In both cases, you should forgive yourself and your partner and remove the blame so as to work on the real causes behind the affair. However, avoid feeling pressured to forgive all at once. Forgiveness is a process and it takes times. The process can sometimes take several months to several years for you to fully heal.","Although  ""forgetting"" your ex may sound like a good remedy for the pain, you don't necessarily want to forget everything you learned from the relationship.

2661,xxx,xxx,xxx,xxx,Relieve Lower Back Pain Through Stretching,xxx,Your skeletal muscles are naturally flexible. This is the reason why human movement is possible. Your muscles are made up of anatomical structures called muscle fibers that contain polymerized protein molecules called myosin and actin filaments. These protein structures are responsible for the actual contraction (movement) of your muscles.,"Some of our muscles are so weak they won't respond to normal efforts, they only move when you really force it and often other muscles are engaged. Your small toe is a nice metaphor/example for other weak muscles on your body. Most people can't separate the small toe from the other four because the muscles governing its movement are weak in comparison; you end up moving everything just to move the one you want. So, one way to gain control over the movement of this toe is to make a small effort to move your little toe without worrying whether it moves or not--so that IF your little toe was strong enough, it WOULD move. The point of this is to become aware of how it feels to flex just those particular muscles. By being aware of the muscle it will build neurons in your brain for the muscles and movement you want, speeding things up a bit. If you try to do this every day, maybe multiple times a day, the muscle WILL eventually get strong enough that you'll see tiny movements. After a while you'll be in complete control. I like this method because it practices mindfulness, and you'll be training yourself not to engage the muscles of the other 4 toes--thereby killing two birds with one stone!","To stay healthy a rabbit's digestive system must function continuously. This involves the gut wall moving the contents along using peristaltic waves (muscular contractions) so that the gut contents is constantly mixing with fresh bacteria and the nutrients extracted. The energy is released from the plant material with the aid of bacteria, which help to break up the cellulose and make the natural sugars, vitamins, and minerals available to the rabbit.","Different muscles perform different functions, so certain muscles may naturally have more fast twitch or slow twitch fibers. For example, your soleus muscle in your lower leg is mainly responsible for sitting and maintaining your posture. These are mainly endurance-based activities, so the soleus doesn't have a ton of fast twitch fibers. This doesn't really impact anything from an exercise perspective, though.",0

The septic tank is an anaerobic (wet) environment where most yeasts and other additives will have little or no effect on the sewage. Some old school installers want to put an additive, a shovel full of sludge or a dead cat in a new tank to ""start"" the septic process. What goes naturally into the tank is all that is required. The aerobic (moist or dry) portion of the system is hundreds of square feet of drain field where additives will not do much good even if they get that far. There is no independent study of the use of additives in septic systems published in any credible scientific journal available anywhere in this country. Your local health department will likely confirm this opinion.","Some swamp coolers use dump pumps to remove the impure water from the filtration system.

After cooling to room temperature, pour the boiled water into a filtered water pitcher (typical brand names are Brita, Culligan, and Pur) with a fresh filter. Depending on the pitcher, this will reduce most heavy metals, chemicals, and other contaminants to safe levels for temporary use. You may also choose to use a steam distiller to purify the water for drinking and cooking purposes. Steam distillation removes more impurities than filters.",2

This helps with down payments/move-in fees like first and last month's rent, and the like.  Generally, this is most successful if the child has no idea that the parents plan to do this until the gift of the cash is presented.
